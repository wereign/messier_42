The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a
single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between
Python astronomy packages. This repository contains the core package which is
intended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed
for performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.

Releases are `registered on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/astropy>`_,
and development is occurring at the
`project's GitHub page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

 Welcome to the Skyfield Repository
====================================

Skyfield is a pure-Python astronomy package
that is compatible with both Python 2 and 3
and makes it easy to generate high precision research-grade
positions for planets and Earth satellites.

.. code-block:: python

   from skyfield.api import load

   planets = load('de421.bsp')
   earth, mars = planets['earth'], planets['mars']

   ts = load.timescale()
   t = ts.now()
   position = earth.at(t).observe(mars)
   ra, dec, distance = position.radec()

   print(ra)
   print(dec)
   print(distance)

The result:

::

   10h 47m 56.24s
   +09deg 03' 23.1"
   2.33251 au

Skyfield’s only binary dependency is NumPy.
Once that is available, Skyfield can usually be installed with::

    pip install skyfield

# Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) microservice

A microservice written in Python with the [Flask micro framework](http://flask.pocoo.org).

## NOTES: 
### Code re-organization has occurred [2020-05-04]!
Code was reorganized to make it work more easily on AWS's Elastic Beanstalk service.

The changes over previous version were :
1. Moved main code out of the APOD folder and into the top level directory as Elastic Beanstalk had a hard time finding the initial python file unless it was in the top-level folder. 
2. Changed service.py to application.py
3. Changed references to app in application.py to application

You can find a frozen version of the previous code in the branch called <a href="https://github.com/nasa/apod-api/tree/prevCodeOrganization">"prevCodeOrganization"</a>

#### API Reliability
A very large number of people use the instance of this API that NASA has set up. If you need a extremely reliable version of this API, you likely want to stand up your own version of the API. You can do that with this code! All information that this API returns is actually just grabbed from the <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html'>Astronomy Photo of the Day Website</a> (APOD).

#### Content Related Issues
No one watching this repository has anything to do with Astronomy Photo of the Day website, so we're unable to deal with issues directly related to their content. Please contact them directly.

### Endpoint: `/<version>/apod`

There is only one endpoint in this service which takes 2 optional fields
as parameters to a http GET request. A JSON dictionary is returned nominally.

#### URL Search Params | query string parameters

- `api_key` | demo: `DEMO_KEY` | https://api.nasa.gov/#signUp
- `date` A string in YYYY-MM-DD format indicating the date of the APOD image (example: 2014-11-03).  Defaults to today's date.  Must be after 1995-06-16, the first day an APOD picture was posted.  There are no images for tomorrow available through this API.
- `concept_tags` A boolean `True|False` indicating whether concept tags should be returned with the rest of the response.  The concept tags are not necessarily included in the explanation, but rather derived from common search tags that are associated with the description text.  (Better than just pure text search.)  Defaults to False.
- `hd` A boolean `True|False` parameter indicating whether or not high-resolution images should be returned. This is present for legacy purposes, it is always ignored by the service and high-resolution urls are returned regardless.
- `count` A positive integer, no greater than 100. If this is specified then `count` randomly chosen images will be returned in a JSON array. Cannot be used in conjunction with `date` or `start_date` and `end_date`.
- `start_date` A string in YYYY-MM-DD format indicating the start of a date range. All images in the range from `start_date` to `end_date` will be returned in a JSON array. Cannot be used with `date`.
- `end_date` A string in YYYY-MM-DD format indicating that end of a date range. If `start_date` is specified without an `end_date` then `end_date` defaults to the current date.
- `thumbs` A boolean parameter `True|False` inidcating whether the API should return a thumbnail image URL for video files. If set to `True`, the API returns URL of video thumbnail. If an APOD is not a video, this parameter is ignored.

**Returned fields**

- `resource` A dictionary describing the `image_set` or `planet` that the response illustrates, completely determined by the structured endpoint.
- `concept_tags` A boolean reflection of the supplied option.  Included in response because of default values.
- `title` The title of the image.
- `date` Date of image. Included in response because of default values.
- `url` The URL of the APOD image or video of the day.
- `hdurl` The URL for any high-resolution image for that day. Returned regardless of 'hd' param setting but will be omitted in the response IF it does not exist originally at APOD.
- `media_type` The type of media (data) returned. May either be 'image' or 'video' depending on content.
- `explanation` The supplied text explanation of the image.
- `concepts` The most relevant concepts within the text explanation.  Only supplied if `concept_tags` is set to True.
- `thumbnail_url` The URL of thumbnail of the video. 
- `copyright` The name of the copyright holder.
- `service_version` The service version used.

    thousand years ago a star in the constellation of Vela could be seen to explode,
    creating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the
    beginning of recorded history. The outer layers of the star crashed into the
    interstellar medium, driving a shock wave that is still visible today. A roughly
    spherical, expanding shock wave is visible in X-rays. The above image captures some
    of that filamentary and gigantic shock in visible light. As gas flies away from the
    detonated star, it decays and reacts with the interstellar medium, producing light
    in many different colors and energy bands. Remaining at the center of the Vela
    Supernova Remnant is a pulsar, a star as dense as nuclear matter that rotates
    completely around more than ten times in a single second.",

Fortunately, the alignment of bright planets and the Moon is one of the most inspiring sights in the night sky and one that is often easy to enjoy and share without any special equipment. Take tonight, for example. Those blessed with clear skies can simply step outside near sunset and view a young crescent Moon very near three bright planets in the west Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn. Jupiter will be the unmistakable brightest star near the Moon with a reddish Mars just to Jupiter's north and pale yellow Saturn directly above. Of course, these sky shows create an evocative picture but the planets and Moon just appear to be near each other -- they are actually only approximately lined up and lie in widely separated orbits. Unfortunately, next month's highly publicized alignment of planets on May 5th will be lost from view in the Sun's glare but such planetary alignments occur repeatedly and pose no danger to planet Earth.",

    "explanation": "A new star, likely the brightest supernova in recorded human history, lit up planet Earth's sky in the year 1006 AD. The expanding debris cloud from the stellar explosion, found in the southerly constellation of Lupus, still puts on a cosmic light show across the electromagnetic spectrum. In fact, this composite view includes X-ray data in blue from the Chandra Observatory, optical data in yellowish hues, and radio image data in red. Now known as the SN 1006 supernova remnant, the debris cloud appears to be about 60 light-years across and is understood to represent the remains of a white dwarf star. Part of a binary star system, the compact white dwarf gradually captured material from its companion star. The buildup in mass finally triggered a thermonuclear explosion that destroyed the dwarf star. Because the distance to the supernova remnant is about 7,000 light-years, that explosion actually happened 7,000 years before the light reached Earth in 1006. Shockwaves in the remnant accelerate particles to extreme energies and are thought to be a source of the mysterious cosmic rays.",

What wonders lie at the center of our Galaxy? Astronomers now know of some of the bizarre objects which exist there, like vast dust clouds,\r bright young stars, swirling rings of gas, and possibly even a large black hole. Much of the Galactic center region is shielded from our view in visible light by the intervening dust and gas. But it can be explored using other forms of electromagnetic radiation, like radio, infrared, X-rays, and gamma rays. This beautiful high resolution image of the Galactic center region in infrared light was made by the SPIRIT III telescope onboard the Midcourse Space Experiment. The center itself appears as a bright spot near the middle of the roughly 1x3 degree field of view, the plane of the Galaxy is vertical, and the north galactic pole is towards the right. The picture is in false color - starlight appears blue while dust is greenish grey, tending to red in the cooler areas.",

The two rings are connected not only by a bar of bright stars but by dark lanes of dust. Inside of this inner ring, dust continues to spiral right into the very center -- possibly the location of a large black hole.

#### Copyright
If you are re-displaying imagery, you may want to check for the presence of the copyright. Anything without a copyright returned field is generally NASA and in the public domain. Please see the <a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html>"About image permissions"</a> section on the main Astronomy Photo of the Day site for more information.

## The APOD Parser<a name="TheAPODParser"></a>

<i>The APOD Parser is not part of the API itself. </i> Rather is intended to be used for accessing the APOD API quickly with Python without writing much additional code yourself. It is found in the apod_parser folder.

### Usage

1. First import the `apod_object_parser.py` file.

2. Now use the `get_data` function and pass your API key as the only argument. You can get the API key <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/#signUp">here</a>

```python
response = apod_object_parser.get_data(<your_api_key>)
```

3. Now you can use the following functions:

-> `apod_object_parser.get_date(response)`

## Deployed <a name="Deployed"></a>
The deployed version of this API is based on the `eb` branch. The version that was deployed before that is in the `eb_previous` branch. The `master` branch is used as development as that's where most of the pull requests will come into anyways.

This API is deployed on AWS using elastic beanstalk due to large number of people who use the service. However, if you're planning on using it just yourself, it is small enough to be stood up on a single micro EC2 or any other small size cloud compute machine.

AstroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining
built on numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib,
and distributed under the BSD license.
It contains a growing library of statistical and machine learning
routines for analyzing astronomical data in python, loaders for several open
astronomical datasets, and a large suite of examples of analyzing and
visualizing astronomical datasets.

This project was started in 2012 by Jake VanderPlas to accompany the book
*Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy* by
Zeljko Ivezic, Andrew Connolly, Jacob VanderPlas, and Alex Gray.

Installation
============

**Before installation, make sure your system meets the prerequisites
listed in Dependencies, listed below.**

Core
----
To install the core ``astroML`` package in your home directory, use::

  pip install astroML

A conda package for astroML is also available either on the conda-forge or
on the astropy conda channels::

  conda install -c astropy astroML

The core package is pure python, so installation should be straightforward
on most systems.  To install from source, use::

  python setup.py install

You can specify an arbitrary directory for installation using::

  python setup.py install --prefix='/some/path'

To install system-wide on Linux/Unix systems::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install


Dependencies
============
There are two levels of dependencies in astroML.  *Core* dependencies are
required for the core ``astroML`` package. *Optional* dependencies are required
to run some (but not all) of the example scripts.  Individual example scripts
will list their optional dependencies at the top of the file.

Core Dependencies
-----------------
The core ``astroML`` package requires the following (some of the
functionality might work with older versions):

- Python_ version 3.6+
- Numpy_ >= 1.13
- Scipy_ >= 0.19
- Scikit-learn_ >= 0.18
- Matplotlib_ >= 3.0
- AstroPy_ >= 3.0

Optional Dependencies
---------------------
Several of the example scripts require specialized or upgraded packages.
These requirements are listed at the top of the particular scripts

- HEALPy_ provides an interface to
  the HEALPix pixelization scheme, as well as fast spherical harmonic
  transforms.

Development
===========
This package is designed to be a repository for well-written astronomy code,
and submissions of new routines are encouraged.  After installing the
version-control system Git_, you can check out
the latest sources from GitHub_ using::

  git clone git://github.com/astroML/astroML.git

or if you have write privileges::

  git clone git@github.com:astroML/astroML.git

Contribution
------------
We strongly encourage contributions of useful astronomy-related code:
for `astroML` to be a relevant tool for the python/astronomy community,
it will need to grow with the field of research.  There are a few
guidelines for contribution:

General
~~~~~~~
Any contribution should be done through the github pull request system (for
more information, see the
`help page <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_
Code submitted to ``astroML`` should conform to a BSD-style license,
and follow the `PEP8 style guide <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

Documentation and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All submitted code should be documented following the
`Numpy Documentation Guide`_.  This is a unified documentation style used
by many packages in the scipy universe.

In addition, it is highly recommended to create example scripts that show the
usefulness of the method on an astronomical dataset (preferably making use
of the loaders in ``astroML.datasets``).  These example scripts are in the
``examples`` subdirectory of the main source repository.

PyEphem README
==============

.. _ephem: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ephem/
.. _pyephem: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyephem/
.. _XEphem: http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem/

PyEphem provides an ``ephem`` Python package
for performing high-precision astronomy computations.
The underlying numeric routines are coded in C
and are the same ones that drive the popular `XEphem`_ astronomy application,
whose author, Elwood Charles Downey,
generously gave permission for their use in PyEphem.
The name *ephem* is short for the word *ephemeris*,
which is the traditional term for a table
giving the position of a planet, asteroid, or comet for a series of dates.

The `PyEphem web site`_ offers documentation
and also links to the project bug tracker, user support forum,
and source code repository.
If you have a C compiler and the
`pip Python installer tool <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_
on your system,
then installing PyEphem should be as easy as::

  pip install ephem

There are also Windows installers in the downloads section below.

The design of PyEphem emphasizes convenience and ease of use.
Both celestial bodies and the observer's location on Earth
are represented by Python objects,
while dates and angles automatically print themselves
in standard astronomical formats::

 >>> import ephem
 >>> mars = ephem.Mars()
 >>> mars.compute('2008/1/1')
 >>> print(mars.ra)
 5:59:27.35
 >>> print(mars.dec)
 26:56:27.4

The documentation includes both a `Quick Reference`_ and a `Tutorial`_,
which are included in text files within the module itself
as well as being available on the `PyEphem web site`_.

The features provided by PyEphem include:

* Find where a planet, comet, or asteroid is in the sky.

  * High-precision orbital routines are provdied
    for the Moon, Sun, planets, and the major planet moons.
  * The user can supply the orbital elements of a comet, asteroid,
    or Earth-orbiting satellite, and have its location computed.
  * The positions of 94 bright stars come built-in,
    and the user can create further fixed objects as needed
    for their calculations.

* Determine where in the sky an object appears for a particular observer.

  * The user can supply the longitude, latitude, and altitude
    of the location from which they will be observing.
  * For convenience, a small database of longitudes and latitudes
    for 122 world cities is included.
  * For specified weather conditions (temperature and pressure),
    PyEphem will compensate for atmospheric refraction
    by adjusting the positions of bodies near the horizon.

* Compute when a body will rise, transit overhead, and set
  from a particular location.

* Parse and use orbital data in either the traditional XEphem file format,
  or the standard TLE format used for tracking Earth-orbiting satellites.

* Determine the dates of the equinoxes and solstices.

* Compute the dates of the various phases of the Moon.

* Convert from the Greenwich Time (more precisely, Ephemeris Time)
  which PyEphem uses to the local time of the user.

* Convert positions between the equatorial, ecliptic, and galactic
  coordinate systems.

* Determine on which page of the Uranometria or the Millennium Star Atlas
  a particular star should appear.

* Return the Julian Date corresponding to any calendar date.

Developers
----------

If you are interested in learning about how PyEphem works or in
exploring its source code, check out this repository from GitHub.  It is
hosted at:

https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem

If you lack expertise with version control, you can instead simply
download a static copy of the most recent source code using this link:

https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/archive/master.zip

To run its source code in place, create a `virtual environment
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_, activate
it, change directory to the root of the PyEphem source code, and run::

    python setup.py build_ext -i

You can then run the PyEphem test suite to see whether all of its
features are working correctly on your operating system and platform::

    python -m unittest discover ephem

PyEphem’s documentation is organized as a standard `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ document project.  You can
build the documentation either with the Sphinx command line::

    sphinx-build -b html pyephem/ephem/doc/ ./my_documentation_directory/

— or, more typically, by invoking one of the targets in the
documentation’s Makefile::

    make -C ephem/doc html

### About

This is the source for the openastronomy.github.io website.

### Building

To build the site locally, you will need [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to be installed.
Clone this repository locally, then inside it, type:

```shell
gem install bundler
bundler install
```
Depending on your Ruby setup this may require superuser privileges to install to the default location, so you may want to instead use:

```shell

gem install -i vendor/bundle bundler
bundle config --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install

```

to install the dependencies locally at `vendor/bundle`.

You can then build the website with:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll build
```

To view the site locally, you will then need to run:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

this will track the changes and rebuild automatically. However, it won't reflect changes on `_config.yaml` 


### Building using a Jekyll container

```bash
mkdir -p ../vendor/bundle # so it's available for other projects
export JEKYLL_VERSION=3.8
# only needs to run it once to download the dependencies
docker run --rm -e BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG="/srv/vendor/bundle" -e BUNDLE_HOME="/srv/vendor/bundle" -e BUNDLE_PATH="/srv/vendor/bundle" --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/../vendor:/srv/vendor" -it jekyll/jekyll:$JEKYLL_VERSION  bundle install
# build
docker run --rm -e BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG="/srv/vendor/bundle" -e BUNDLE_HOME="/srv/vendor/bundle" -e BUNDLE_PATH="/srv/vendor/bundle" --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" --volume="$PWD/../vendor:/srv/vendor" -it jekyll/jekyll:$JEKYLL_VERSION  bundle exec jekyll build
# serve from python
python -m http.server -d _site
```

### Submodule

Note that this uses a submodule to complete the build process of the site.  So you may need to do:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
in a fresh clone, or just the second line to update the submodule.

## Development guide

The original simulations are written in ActionScript 2.0. To open the .fla files, you'll need an older version of Adobe Animate than the current version (19.1). You can download a trial version of Adobe Flash Professional CS4 [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/cs4-product-downloads.html)
and open the .fla files with this. Also, Flash Professional CS6 can also open these files. Adobe doesn't distribute Flash Professional anymore. The only way I've found to read the source files is by opening the .swf files in [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler
](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler).

To get to the code, go to Window -> Actions. The bottom-left panel
should have the code hierarchy. 

Here are instructions on how to develop and make changes to these simulations. If you're using Windows, replace the forward slashes with back-slashes.

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone this repository
* Go into one of the simulations, e.g.: `cd astro-simulations/lunar-phase-simulator`
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run serve`
* Wait for the build to complete. It takes a while.
* Open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

You can also use the `npm run dev` command if all you want to do is
make a development build of a simulation without using
[webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). Three.js
has an overview of this in [How to run things locally](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally).
Both `npm run dev` and `npm run serve` watch the `src/` directory for file
changes.

Here are some blog posts I've made about these simulations:
* [How to animate graphical JavaScript programs](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/articles/how-to-animate-graphical-javascript-programs/)
* [How to make an analog clock (Part 1)](https://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2018/9/27.html)
* [How to work with Planes in three.js](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/articles/planes-in-threejs/)
* [How to make a draggable dialog box in JavaScript](https://www.columbia.edu/~njn2118/journal/2019/4/26.html)
* [How to Simulate Gas Particles With Matter.js](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/articles/how-to-simulate-gas-particles-with-matterjs/)

There's also the [Conversion Guide](https://ccnmtl.github.io/astro-simulations/docs/conversion-guide.html)
 that documents how to put together a new interactive.

## Announcement:
Check this link to [Pathways to Science website ](https://pathwaystoscience.org/Undergrads.aspx) to find Summer 2021 Undergraduate Research Opportunities including SETI opportunities at [Breakthrough Listen](https://seti.berkeley.edu/Internship.html) and Berkeley SETI Research Center.

## Welcome
 Welcome to the essential collection of information that you need to begin your journey into Research Astronomy. The following tutorials, readings, projects and tips are designed to for early college students, advanced high school students, and students with nontraditional career paths to gain the skills they need in order to gain entry into a more formal research project. With exposure and eventual mastering of the skills contained in this repository, students will be better prepared to begin research project either during the semester or over the summer.

## Target Audience
This course is designed to be conducted individually or in a group setting. In this second iteration, the focus will be on interaction among students in the group, and less focused on a top down teaching structure. That said, we also hope to provide the opportunity for students to brainstorm and plan their own research projects, a skill that often requires years of practice to master. We have many brilliant graduate PhD students who serve as research mentors and tutorial leaders. No students will be turned away for lack of experience.

## Our Goals
After completion of these tutorials, students will have the skills need to quickly ramp up on new astronomy research projects, without the need to brush up on basic skills. The astronomy skills will be focused on, but not limited to exoplanet topics. Students are encouraged to use these skills to explore other realms of Astronomy. Once you have completed all of the tutorials, you will be well qualified for a paid internship in astronomy research. Many of these opportunities fall under the title: Research Experience for Undergraduates, and serve as an excellent way to become qualified for graduate studies in astronomy.

## The Future of the project:
We hope this project becomes self sustaining in such a way that others can contribute and add value to the current set of research skills presented here. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please feel free to contact us through the issue tracker on this repo. If you work in another field such as biology, chemistry, another specialty within astronomy, and are interested in replicating this project for your specific field, please email me directly.

## Code of Conduct
We strive to maintain a welcoming and supportive community for everyone regardless of race, religion, background or identity. Period. For more details, see our Code of Conduct page.

# Casacore

A suite of C++ libraries for radio astronomy data processing.


# Installation

## Debian / Ubuntu

Casacore is now part of Debian and Ubuntu, use apt to search for the package you need:
```bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get search casacore

```

## MacOS

Use Homebrew with the `ska-sa` tap to install casacore:

```bash
$ brew tap ska-sa/tap
$ brew install casacore
```

## Docker

We now also publish docker images for each github branch on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/casacore/casacore):
```
$ docker pull quay.io/casacore/casacore:master
```

## Building from source

### Getting the source code

The casacore source code is maintained on github.

You can obtain it using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/casacore/casacore
```

### Requirements

To compile casacore you need to meet the following requirements:

* cmake
* gfortran
* g++
* flex 
* bison
* blas
* lapack
* cfitsio (3.181 or later)
* wcslib (4.20 or later)
* sofa (optional, only for testing casacore measures)
* fftw3
* hdf5 (optional)
* numpy (optional)
* boost-python (optional)
* ncurses (optional)

On Debian / Ubuntu you can install these with:
 ``` 
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake gfortran g++ libncurses5-dev \
    libreadline-dev flex bison libblas-dev liblapacke-dev libcfitsio-dev \
    wcslib-dev libfftw3-dev
```

and the optional libraries:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev python-numpy \
    libboost-python-dev libpython3.4-dev libpython2.7-dev
```

On CentOS7 you can install these with:
 ```bash 
$ sudo yum install cmake cmake-gui gcc-gfortran gcc-c++ flex bison \
        blas blas-devel  lapack lapack-devel cfitsio cfitsio-devel \
        wcslib wcslib-devel ncurses ncurses-devel readline readline-devel\
        python-devel boost boost-devel fftw fftw-devel hdf5 hdf5-devel\
        numpy boost-python 
```

## Obtaining measures data

Various parts of casacore require measures data, which requires regular
updating. You can obtain the WSRT measures archive from the ASTRON FTP server:

ftp://ftp.astron.nl/outgoing/Measures/

Extract this somewhere on a permanent location on your filesystem.


## Compilation

In the casacore source folder run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
make install
```

there are various flags available to cmake to enable and disable options:
```
$ cmake -DDATA_DIR=/usr/share/casacore/data -DUSE_OPENMP=ON \
    -DUSE_HDF5=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON -DUSE_THREADS=ON
```

The `DATA_DIR` should point to the location where you extracted the measures
data. Special variables `%CASAROOT%` and `%CASAHOME%` can be used here, which
can be set at run time through the `.casarc` file.

You can build python3 support using `-DBUILD_PYTHON3=ON`. Note that CMake may
have problems detecting the correct python3 libraries and headers, so probably
you need to set them manually. For
example:
```
-DPYTHON3_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.4m.so
-DPYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.4
```

To configure Python2 specific settings use:
```
PYTHON2_EXECUTABLE
PYTHON2_LIBRARY
PYTHON2_INCLUDE_DIR
```

To configure Python3 specific settings use:
```
PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE
PYTHON3_LIBRARY
PYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR
```

If you run into problems with boost libraries, try setting `-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=True`. This will be necessary if you have the libraries from NRAO casa in your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

# Astronomy and Python Coding Activities

**Website** - [astropython.com](https://www.astropython.com)
Be sure to check out my website for details on the code, the [astroedu](https://github.com/astroDimitrios/astroedu) package, ways to get involved, and other teaching resources.

My YouTube channel [astroDimitrios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8Sg-cgLNubyCM5Em8eDZg/featured) has videos of some activities and challenges as well as beginner intro videos.

## Intro

This directory contains code on various Astronomy topics.

The goal of the coding activities are mainly to **process** and **visualise** data and **extract physical insights** from them (as described in the AAPT report below). Although by performing the activities students will inevitably also learn debugging, how to convert theory/models into code, and how to present data formally in a document or presentation.

The outputs (figures etc) were designed to be a starting point for my students to put their own data and visualisations in their reports and presentations. My hope is this will promote a deeper understanding of the topic and better engage the students/encourage ownership and pride in their work.  

Some are best done in pairs like the intro activities. Activities are designed to take at most an hour with some taking an hour and a half (AstPy-004 and AstPy-006 for instance).

Each code has a teacher version with all outputs. These have the suffix Teacher. The student file is much smaller as it is missing the outputs and has code completition tasks for the students to complete.

# Challenges

Astronomy and Python challenge excercises are now stored in the ***Challenges*** directory. As of the 2022 Maintenance Update 1 no new challenges will be issued as I work towards a more impactful way to engage the community, see [here](https://www.astropython.com/challenge.html).

## How to run the code

**2022 Maintenance Update 1**: A basic conda environment file ***env.yml*** is provided which most activities will run in, which is just a normal scientific Python stack with astropy. Some activities have their own ***.yml*** file with extra dependencies.

<p><strong>Testing Activites:</strong>If you would like to test any activities online you can email me and I will activate our JupyterHub server for 48 hours. Unfortunately I can no longer keep it running 24/7 due to running costs. When the server is up - Sign up <a href="https://hub.astropython.com/hub/signup">here</a> with a username and password then head over to <a href="https://hub.astropython.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FastroDimitrios%2FLaunch&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FLaunch%2FWelcome.ipynb&branch=main">hub.astropython.com</a> and log in! (It's important to use the second link after signing up so you get sent to the Welcome document)

**NOTE:** The server may go down periodically. If you want to keep your work please download it to your local computer, do NOT assume it is safe forever on the hub. 

The welcome document has links which pull the activities you want to try from my GitHub. If something doesn't work please let me know! The server is built for my students so it can only handle 20-30 people at a time. If you do test out some of the activities let me know what you think.</p>

**Alternate ways of running notebooks**

The .ipynb files can be run my going to https://jupyter.org/try.  
Click on **Try JupyterLab** and wait for it to load.  
Upload the **.ipynb** file using the Upload File button (little upwards arrow in the top right).

Or you could install JupyterLab on your local machine.

The **.ipynb** files contain tasks for students. The Teacher **.ipynb** file contains the solutions.

**NOTE** - Sometimes there is a **.py** file with solutions and code to create more complex figures. I have NOT checked that these will run on JupyterLab. They were used to test my code before creating the interactive JupyterLab Notebooks.

## Data

There is now a ***Data*** directory where all data is stored. I will continue to keep all data files needed in their respective assignment directories as well. Some activity data is stored on Google Drive due to large file sizes. Links are given inside the individual activity directories if applicable.

## Assignment grading

**nbgrader**

[nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a tool to make assignments out of notebooks and mark them.

I have integrated this easily with the notebooks - email me for more info. As of 2022 Maintenance Cycle 1 nbgrader files are no longer tracked/uploaded t o this repo.## AstroCV

[AstroCV](https://github.com/astroCV/astroCV) is a package intended to contain computer vision algorithms and methods for processing and analyzing astronomical datasets. The main goal is developing and promoting the use of modern computer vision algorithms for solving scientific problems in astronomy.

For installation instructions, see the online documentation for required libraries or check the installation guide installation_guide.md in this source distribution.

The paper on AstroCV is in this [file](https://github.com/astroCV/astroCV/blob/master/ASTROCV_ASCOM_ACCEPTED_ARXIV_VERSION.pdf)

## Contents

### galaxy_detection

In README.md you can find a detailed guide on how to train your own network.

Four examples can be found in this folder. These examples show detections in different images. The first and second example work with .jpg images. The third example downloads images from the web. The fourth example processes three .fits images for the same photo (i, r and g filters), then applies different filters to the rgb matrix (e.g. lupton, sqrt) and finally tests the detector with the images. 

In the traning folder, you can find .py codes to download the images from SDSS, convert them into .jpg and process and prepare files to be traning ready.

### tutorials

This folder contains introductive tutorials to computer vision, deep learning and creating a dataset from the NGFS survey.

### tools/color_image

In this folder you can find two .py scripts for making galaxy snapshots and creating .jpg images.

## About Virgo
**Virgo** is an easy-to-use **open-source** spectrometer and radiometer based on [Python](https://www.python.org) and [GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org) (GR) that is conveniently applicable to any radio telescope working with a GR-supported software-defined radio (SDR). In addition to data acquisition, Virgo also carries out automated analysis of the recorded samples, producing an **averaged spectrum**, a **calibrated spectrum**, a **dynamic spectrum (waterfall)**, a **time series (power vs time)** and a **total power distribution** plot.

Lastly, an important set of utilities is provided to observers, making the package for a great tool for planning (radio) observations, estimating the system sensitivity of an instrument, and many more.

## Statement of Need

Designed to be used by students, educators and amateurs in the field of radio astronomy, Virgo has already been adopted by a number of small and large-aperture radio telescopes, permitting both spectral and continuum observations with great success. These instruments include the ISEC TLM-18 (18m), the ACRO RT-320 (3.2m), the JRT (1.9m), and the PICTOR Telescope (1.5m), among others.

Although the hardware aspect of a radio telescope is generally handled by newcomers with relative ease, the skill set needed to integrate a complete software pipeline to support observations is not something most users are equipped with. Virgo tackles this problem by providing non-experts with a tool to collect and interpret data from radio telescopes, without requiring expertise in digital signal processing and software engineering. An example use case is classroom experiments in which students build a small-aperture antenna connected to a low-noise amplifier followed by an SDR, and with the help of Virgo, obtain data to map out the galactic distribution of neutral hydrogen and/or derive the rotation curve of the Milky Way.

## Data Acquisition Flowgraph
**Virgo** is a **four-tap WOLA Fourier transform** spectrometer. The raw I/Q samples are processed in real time using GNU Radio, with the amount of data stored to file being drastically reduced for further analysis. The following flowgraph handles the acquisition and early-stage processing of the data:

### Example radio map acquired and processed with the help of Virgo (PICTOR Northern HI Survey)
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/pYgMAhW.png "PICTOR HI Survey")

## Installation
To use **Virgo**, make sure **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and **[GNU Radio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR)** (with **[gr-osmosdr](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-osmosdr/wiki)**) are installed on your machine.

For Debian/Ubuntu and derivates, the installation is straightforward:

```
sudo apt install gnuradio gr-osmosdr
```

**Note:** The `GNU Radio` and `gr-osmosdr` dependencies are only required for **acquiring data with the necessary hardware** (software-defined radio). They are not required for planning observations, analyzing data, running calculations or any other functionalities provided by the package. For more information, please refer to the [Dependencies section](https://virgo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#dependencies).

Once Python and GNU Radio are installed on your system, run

This is the source code repository for ERFA (Essential Routines for
Fundamental Astronomy).  ERFA is a C library containing key algorithms for
astronomy, and is based on the `SOFA library <http://www.iausofa.org/>`_ published by the International
Astronomical Union (IAU).

ERFA is intended to replicate the functionality of SOFA (aside from possible
bugfixes in ERFA that have not yet been included in SOFA), but is licensed
under a three-clause BSD license to enable its compatibility with a wide
range of open source licenses. Permission for this release has been
obtained from the SOFA board, and is available in the ``LICENSE`` file included
in this source distribution.

Differences from SOFA
---------------------

This version of ERFA (v2.0.0) is based on SOFA version "20210512", with the
differences outlined below.

ERFA branding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All references to "SOFA" in the source code have been changed to ERFA, and
functions have the prefix ``era`` instead of ``iau``.

C macro prefixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All C macros used in ERFA are the same as their SOFA equivalents, but with an
``ERFA_`` prefix to prevent namespace collisions.

Version information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ERFA provides a few utility functions for accessing version information at
runtime which are not a part of SOFA.  Specifically, these are the
``eraVersion``, ``eraVersion*``, and ``eraSofaVersion`` functions that are
exposed in the ``erfaextra.h`` header.

Runtime leap second modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ERFA provides the capability to modify at runtime the leap seconds assumed for
various calculations. These are accessed via the ``eraGetLeapSeconds`` and
``eraSetLeapSeconds`` functions that are exposed in the ``erfaextra.h`` header.
This functionality is currently considered somewhat experimental, meaning an
improved API might be available in the future, but the current API can also be
counted on for the near future.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

ERFA includes smaller changes that may or may not eventually make it into SOFA,
addressing localized bugs or similar smaller issues:

* ERFA 2.0.0 and SOFA "20210512"

  + Functionally, there no differences except for the added ``eraVersion``,
    ``eraSofaVersion``, and leap second functions noted above.
  + The three new functions added in SOFA are added to ERFA as well.
  + Like for SOFA, one now has to explicitly include ``erfam.h`` to use its
    macros defining constants, etc. Including just ``erfa.h`` (or
    ``erfaextra.h``) will no longer includes ``erfam.h`` implicitly.

* ERFA 1.7.3 and SOFA "20210125_a"

  + Only a small bug fix in the SOFA release.  The only differences
    between ERFA 1.7.3 and SOFA "20210125_a" remain the added ``eraVersion``,
    ``eraSofaVersion``, and leap second functions noted above.

* ERFA 1.7.2 and SOFA "20210125"

  + Only bug and accuracy fixes in the SOFA release.  The only differences
    between ERFA 1.7.2 and SOFA "20210125" remain the added ``eraVersion``,
    ``eraSofaVersion``, and leap second functions noted above.

* ERFA 1.7.1 and SOFA "20200721"

  + Only bug fixes in the SOFA release.  The only differences between ERFA 1.7.1
    and SOFA "20200721" remain the added ``eraVersion``, ``eraSofaVersion``, and
    leap second functions noted above.

* ERFA 1.7.0 and SOFA "20190722"

  + There are no differences between ERFA 1.7.0 and SOFA "20190722" except
    for the added ``eraVersion``, ``eraSofaVersion``, and leap second functions
    noted above.

* ERFA 1.6.0 and SOFA "20190722"

  + There are no differences between ERFA 1.6.0 and SOFA "20190722" except
    for the ``eraVersion`` and ``eraSofaVersion`` functions added in ERFA 1.4.0.

* ERFA 1.5.0 and SOFA "20180130"

  + There are no differences between ERFA 1.5.0 and SOFA "20180130" except
    for the ``eraVersion`` and ``eraSofaVersion`` functions added in ERFA 1.4.0.

* ERFA 1.4.0 and SOFA "20170420"

  + ERFA 1.4.0 adds the ``eraVersion`` and ``eraSofaVersion`` functions to
    determine the installed version of ERFA (and the SOFA version it is derived
    from).

  + ERFA 1.4.0 includes some bug fixes contributed to ERFA after 1.3.0 but
    before 1.4.0.  These were incorporated (with modification) into
    SOFA "20170420" (without attribution) and hence these are not differences
    between ERFA and SOFA. (See https://github.com/liberfa/erfa/issues/40 and
    https://github.com/liberfa/erfa/issues/41)

* ERFA 1.3.0 and SOFA "20160503_a"

  + There are no differences between ERFA 1.3.0 and SOFA "20160503_a".

* ERFA 1.2.0 and SOFA "20150209_a"

  + Typos have been corrected in the documentation of atco13 and atio13 (see https://github.com/liberfa/erfa/issues/29).

Note that issues identified in ERFA should generally also be reported upstream to SOFA at sofa@ukho.gov.uk.

Building and installing ERFA
----------------------------

To build and install a released version of ERFA in your OS's standard
location, you need to install `meson <https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html>`_
and `ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_. On Debian-based OSes, these
can be installed with ``apt install meson``.

Then, simply do::

    meson setup builddir/
    ninja -C builddir/
    meson install -C builddir/

If you want to run the tests to make sure ERFA built correctly, before
installing do::

    meson test -C builddir/


For developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to build against the ERFA static library without installing, you
can add ``$PWD/builddir/meson-uninstalled/`` to the ``$PKG_CONFIG_PATH``
variable. Other projects will then be able to pick up and link to the uninstalled
dependency using pkg-config as normal.

Creating a single-file version of the source code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, if you wish to bundle the ERFA source code with a separate
package, you can use the ``source_flattener.py`` script from the
`erfa-fetch repository`_ to combine
the ERFA source code into just two files: a ``erfa.c`` source file, and an
``erfa.h`` include file.  You should run this script like this::

    cd /path/to/erfa-source-code
    python /path/to/erfa-fetch/source_flattener.py src -n erfa

If possible, however, it is recommended that you provide an option to use any
copy of the ERFA library that is already installed on the system.

# Open Astronomy Catalog API v1.0

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/https/api.astrocats.space.svg?label=status)](https://github.com/astrocatalogs/OACAPI)

API usage over the last 7 days:

[![Calls](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=successful%20queries&colorB=ff69b4&&query=$.count&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fastrocats.space%2Fapi-count.php&logo=quantopian&logoColor=ff69b4)](https://github.com/astrocatalogs/OACAPI)

The Open Astronomy Catalog API (OACAPI) offers a lightweight, simple way to access data available via the Open Astronomy Catalogs (e.g. the <a href="https://sne.space">Open Supernova</a>, <a href="https://tde.space">Tidal Disruption</a>, <a href="https://kilonova.space">Kilonova</a>, and <a href="https://faststars.space">Fast Stars</a> Catalogs). The API is accessible via a route that works via any of the catalog domains,

https://api.astrocats.space/

https://api.sne.space/

https://api.tde.space/

https://api.kilonova.space/

https://api.faststars.space/

where the only difference is preference in catalog when returning items that appear on multiple catalogs. For the examples below we will (usually) use the api.astrocats.space route. By default, all returned values are provided in JSON format, unless a `format=` URL variable is provided.

## General use

The pattern for the API is one of the domains listed above (e.g. `https://api.astrocats.space`) followed by

`/OBJECT/QUANTITY/ATTRIBUTE?ARGUMENT1=VALUE1&ARGUMENT2=VALUE2&...`

where `OBJECT` is set to a transient's name, `QUANTITY` is set to a desired quantity to retrieve (e.g. redshift), `ATTRIBUTE` is a property of that quantity, and the `ARGUMENT` variables allow to user to filter data based upon various attribute values. The `ARGUMENT` variables can either be used to guarantee that a certain attribute appears in the returned results (e.g. adding `&time&e_magnitude` to the query will guarantee that each returned item has a `time` and `e_magnitude` attribute), or used to filter via a simple equality such as `telescope=HST` (which would only return `QUANTITY` objects where the `telescope` attribute equals `"HST"`), or they can be more powerful for certain filter attributes (examples being `ra` and `dec` for performing cone searches).

Key names that are usable in API calls can be found in the [OAC schema](https://github.com/astrocatalogs/schema). Below, we provide some example queries that demonstrate the API's capabilities.

### Special arguments

There are a few arguments that have special meaning and are only a part of the API, not the schema:

* `closest`: Return the quantities with the closest value to the specified attributes. If multiple attributes are specified, the closest to each will be returned (e.g., `magnitude=15&time=56789&closest` would return *both* the observation with magnitude closest to 15 and time closest to 56789.
* `complete`: Return only quantities containing all of the requested attributes.
* `first`: Return only the first of each of the listed quantities.
* `format=x`: Return data in the specified format `x`, currently supports `csv` and `tsv`. Any other format specification will return `JSON`.
* `item=n`: Return only the `n`th item of each of the listed quantities.
* `radius=r`: Return objects within a distance `r` (in arcseconds) of a given set of `ra` and `dec` coordinates. Note that this disables exact matches for `ra` and `dec`.
* `width=w`: Return objects within a distance `w` (in arcseconds) of a given `ra` value (for box searches).
* `height=h`: Return objects within a distance `h` (in arcseconds) of a given `dec` value (for box searches).
* `sortby=s`: Sort the returned array by the attribute `s` (only works when returning results in `csv`/`tsv` formats).

## Example queries

#### Return basic information about the API service (and a link back to this README)

https://api.astrocats.space/

#### Return all objects within a 2" cone about a set of coordinates

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog?ra=21:23:32.16&dec=-53:01:36.08&radius=2

#### Return all supernova metadata in CSV format

https://api.sne.space/catalog?format=CSV

By default, queries such as the two above will return the catalog entries for objects that satisfy the search conditions. To return data from a specific catalog when searching by a criterion such as position, the user should insert `catalog/` into the URL before the rest of the query of the specific catalog they are interested in, as shown in the example below:

#### Redshifts of all supernovae with a redshift reported within 5° of a coordinate, in CSV format

https://api.sne.space/catalog/redshift?ra=10:42:16.88&dec=-24:13:12.13&radius=18000&format=csv&redshift

If the user instead wishes to return info on all objects across all catalogs, the `all/` route should be used instead (any URL can be used with this route):

#### Redshifts of all objects with a redshift reported within 5° of a coordinate, in CSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog/redshift?ra=10:42:16.88&dec=-24:13:12.13&radius=18000&format=csv&redshift

Individual object queries can return more-detailed information about each object, including datafiles such as spectra. Below, we show some examples of this in action:

#### Get the available redshift values for an object

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/redshift

#### Select the first (preferred) value of the redshift

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/redshift?first, or
https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/redshift?item=0

#### Return all photometric observations with at least one of the `magnitude`, `e_magnitude`, and `band` attributes

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/magnitude+e_magnitude+band

#### Return the above in CSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/magnitude+e_magnitude+band?format=csv

#### Only return observations that contain all requested attributes

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/magnitude+e_magnitude+band?complete

#### Sort the returned photometry by magnitude

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/magnitude+e_magnitude+band?format=csv&sortby=magnitude

#### Return observations for multiple objects at once, in CSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J+SN2015F/photometry/time+magnitude+band?format=csv

#### Return only observations whose attributes include the listed keys (`e_magnitude` and `band`)

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/time+magnitude+e_magnitude+band?e_magnitude&band

#### Return only observations matching given criteria, in this case band = B

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/photometry/magnitude+e_magnitude+band?band=B

In the following example, we filter upon the `value` of `claimedtype`, but note that this filters `lumdist` as well, since the `value` filter applies to both:

#### Luminosity distances and claimed types of all objects with luminosity distance *and* claimed type equal to Ia (probably not what you intend!)

https://api.astrocats.space/all/lumdist+claimedtype?value=ia

Note that the above returns an empty result. Instead, we want to do:

#### Luminosity distances and claimed types of all objects with an available luminosity distance and "Ia" listed as a type, in TSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog/lumdist+claimedtype?lumdist&claimedtype=ia&format=tsv

Regular expressions are also supported in the `ARGUMENT` fields, allowing users to perform more sophisticated matches to attribute values:

#### Claimed types of all objects with a typing that has a prefix matching "Ia-", in TSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog/claimedtype?claimedtype=Ia-(.*)&format=tsv

Note that many regular expression symbols must be URL-encoded to be passed properly to the API.

#### Return the spectrum closest to the listed MJD

https://api.astrocats.space/SN2014J/spectra/time+data?time=56703.2&closest

The `catalog/` route (combined with filtering) can also return data from the individual object files if data isn't contained within the main OAC catalog files (i.e. the data that is visible on the main pages of the Open Supernova Catalog, etc.). Because these queries are expensive (the full dataset must be loaded for each object), they have some numeric limits to prevent overloading the server.

#### Return all photometry in a 2" radius about a coordinate, in CSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog/photometry/time+band+magnitude?ra=21:23:32.16&dec=-53:01:36.08&radius=2&format=csv

#### Return the instruments used to produce spectra within a 5° of a given coordinate, in CSV format

https://api.astrocats.space/catalog/spectra/instrument?ra=21:23:32.16&dec=-53:01:36.08&radius=18000&format=csv
# PythonForAstronomy

Cosmonium is a 3D astronomy and space exploration program. With Cosmonium you can navigate in our solar system and discover all the planets and their moons. You can also visit the neighboring stars and discover the true size of our galaxy and the Universe.

Cosmonium supports (or will support) the creation of fictional planets, stellar systems nebulaes, ... using procedural generation.

Cosmonium also already supports some Celestia addons (though CMOD and CelX are not yet supported).

### Requirements

Cosmonium runs on Windows (Vista or above), Linux (CentOS 5, Ubuntu 14 or above) or macOS (mac0S 10.9 or above)
with a graphic card supporting OpenGL 2.1 or better (OpenGL 4.5 is recommended) and at least 512MB of disk
(up to 4GB if the HD and UHD textures are installed).

### Installation 

Download the installer or package for your platform from the [download](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Download) page and see the [[Installation]] page
The package contains only low resolution textures, see [here](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Download#extra-textures) to install extra HD and UHD textures.

### Screenshots

See in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots) some screenshots of the application with views of
[Saturn](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots#rings-of-saturn),
[Jupiter](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots#io-casting-a-shadow-on-jupiter),
[Mars](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots#phobos-over-mars),
the [Moon](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots#moon-crescent),
[procedural planets](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Screenshots#procedural-planet), ...

![Jupiter](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/screenshots/Io+Jupiter.png)

### Launch

Simply starts cosmonium from your application menu or from the cosmonium folder. See also the [installation](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Installation) page for more options.

### User interface

Cosmonium user interface is still heavily based on Celestia, most of the command and keyboard shortcuts work the same.
Go to [First steps](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/First-steps) to have an explanation of the basic command or see the [Control](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki/Control) page for an exhaustive list.

### Full documentation

Cosmonium is still in its infancy, but it is already usable to explore all the planets and the moons of our solar system, all the neighbor or visible stars and much more.
It also support custom content and addons, either as Cosmonium or Celestia addons.

The full documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/wiki)

### Bugs

If you encounter any problem to install or run Cosmonium, please don't hesitate to fill a bug report in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cosmonium/cosmonium/issues) here on Github.

# PyAstronomy

What is it?
-----------

  PyAstronomy is a collection of astronomy-related
  packages written in Python.

  Currently, the following subpackages are available:

    funcFit:    A convenient fitting package providing support
                for minimization and MCMC sampling.

    modelSuite: A Set of astrophysical models (e.g., transit
                light-curve modeling), which can be used
                stand-alone or with funcFit.

    AstroLib:   A set of useful routines including a number
                of ports from IDL's astrolib.

    Constants:  The package provides a number of often-needed
                constants.

    Timing:     Provides algorithms for timing analysis such as
                the Lomb-Scargle and the Generalized Lomb-Scargle
                periodogram

    pyaGUI:     A collection of GUI tools for interactive work.

Installation
------------

  To install the latest release via pip from PyPI use
  
    pip install PyAstronomy[occult]
    
  or
  
    pip install git+https://github.com/sczesla/PyAstronomy.git#egg=PyAstronomy[occult]
    
  to install the current state from github including non-Python dependencies. Remove [occult]
  to skip these dependencies.
  
  Alternatively, download the source and use
  
    python setup.py [--with-ext] install
    
  If you specify the `--with-ext` flag, setup will try to
  compile non-Python modules.
